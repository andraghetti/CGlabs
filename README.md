# CGlabs
My solutions to the labs of the Computer Graphics course of some years ago (the current year website is [this](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2020/445826))

Everything is done with C++ and a Jurassic Visual Studio version (I think it's the 2012). I had fun completing them and I wanted to preserve them.

- Lab-1: Bezier Curves
- Lab-2: Mesh management
- Lab-3: Blender and MeshLab
- Lab-4: Ray Tracing
- Lab-5: Texture Mapping
- Lab-6: Shaders

Examples:
